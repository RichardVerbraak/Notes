# Simple guidelines to create a beautiful looking website

Most of the guidelines here are either things I've learned myself and from various CSS courses from Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Colours

When picking a design for a website you should consider the psychology behind them.

1. **Red**

   Power, passion, excitement and strength.

2. **Orange** --- Cheerfulness, creativity, draws a lot of attention.

3. **Yellow** --- Energetic, happiness, liveliness.

4. **Green** --- Harmony, nature, life and health, also, money.

5. **Blue** --- Patience, trust, professionalism, calm and coolness.

6. **Purple** --- Nobility, luxury, wisdom and mystery

7. **Pink** --- Romance, care, affection, peace.

8. **Brown** --- Relaxtion, confidence, earthiness, durability, comfort.

**!IMPORTANT!**: _Never_ pick black as a color. It's not a natural color that you'll encounter in the real world either.

## Images

When working with images and text you should consider your site's primary colors and
the text's contrast compared to the image.

There are a few ways to achieve readable text overlayed on an image.

### Text & Backgrounds

======================================================

#### Overlay the image with color

Adding a bit of color over any image can make your text stand out more. Preferably this color should be one of your base colors.
Either just a color applied to the entire background or even better, a _gradient_.

#### Putting text in a box

Just placing text in a box that has a color that contrasts nicely with the background will achieve the same effect as above.
Adding a bit of _opacity_ to that color so the image shines through is also a good addition.

#### Floor fade

A floor fade is if you're planning to add text to the bottom of the image because a floor fade is just overlaying the bottom of the image with some a dark color instead of the entire background.

======================================================

### Drawing attention to the background

Adding animations like scaling the image with ease-in ease-out transformations.

## Icons

Icons can quickly guide your users to where they want to be.

They can also help your users identify what it is they're reading about.

Icons are really useful in navigations (dropdown lists etc.) and links or used in cards with descriptions.

### General tips on Icons

1. Icons should be recognizable.

2. Label your icons to avoid confusion.

3. Icons should not take the center stage, they are a supporting role.

4. Use SVGs whenever possible instead of a static image. SVGs are scaleable in terms of quality.

## Whitespace

Whitespace allows your design to "breathe".

Little whitespace is unreadable and doesn't separate content as nicely.

Too much whitespace and the user won't know the relationship between one part of content and another.
