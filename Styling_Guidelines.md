# Simple guidelines to create a beautiful looking website

Most of the guidelines here are either things I've learned myself and from various CSS courses from Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Typography

    Contrast with background. Minimal. Legible. Max 3 different fonts in max 3 different sizes.

## Colours

When picking a design for a website you should consider the psychology behind them.

1.  **Red**

    - Power, passion, excitement and strength.

2.  **Orange**

    - Cheerfulness, creativity, draws a lot of attention.

3.  **Yellow**

    - Energetic, happiness, liveliness.

4.  **Green**

    - Harmony, nature, life and health, also, money.

5.  **Blue**

    - Patience, trust, professionalism, calm and coolness.

6.  **Purple**

    - Nobility, luxury, wisdom and mystery

7.  **Pink**

    - Romance, care, affection, peace.

8.  **Brown**

    - Relaxation, confidence, earthiness, durability, comfort.

**!!!IMPORTANT!!!** _Never_ pick black as a color. It's not a natural color that you'll encounter in the real world either.

======================================================

### General tips

1.  **Don't use too many colors**

    - Pick at most five colors maximum to create better consistency in your design. More on that below.

2.  **Consistency with colors**

    - Having too many random colors breaks the design.
      In my opinion, you should pick two primary colors
      and have lighter shades of your base colors to use for less important content or text to create visual consistency.

## Images

When working with images and text you should consider your site's primary colors and
the text's contrast compared to the image.

There are a few ways to achieve readable text overlayed on an image.

### Text & Backgrounds

======================================================

#### Overlay the image with color

Adding a bit of color over any image can make your text stand out more. Preferably this color should be one of your base colors.
Either just a color applied to the entire background or even better, a _gradient_.

#### Putting text in a box

Just placing text in a box that has a color that contrasts nicely with the background will achieve the same effect as above.
Adding a bit of _opacity_ to that color so the image shines through is also a good addition.

#### Floor fade

A floor fade is if you're planning to add text to the bottom of the image because a floor fade is just overlaying the bottom of the image with a
_dark color_ instead of the entire background.

======================================================

### Drawing attention to the background

Adding animations like scaling the image with ease-in ease-out transformations.

## Icons

Icons can quickly _guide your users_ to where they want to be.

They can also help your users identify what it is they're reading about.

Icons are really useful in navigations (dropdown lists etc.) and links or used in cards with descriptions.

### General tips on Icons

1. Icons should be _recognizable_.

2. Label your icons to avoid confusion.

3. Icons should **not** take the center stage, they are a supporting role.

4. Use _SVGs_ whenever possible instead of a static image. SVGs are scaleable in terms of quality.

## Whitespace

Whitespace allows your design to "breathe".

Little whitespace is unreadable and doesn't separate content as nicely.

Too much whitespace and the user won't know the relationship between one part of content and another.

## Visual Hierarchy

This is used to separate the _most_ important content on your page from the _least_ important content. Defining visual hierarchy is done by following the next guidelines

1.  **Establish where your audience should look first**

    - As an example, having a bright orange CTA button in the main header of your Blog page to get people to subscribe to your posts.

      Changing to a smaller font family / size / weight for less important content.

2.  **Define a flow that corresponds to your website's message**

    - This is used to guide a user from one piece of content to the next.

3.  **Use whitespace to build said flow**

    - Whitespace if done right makes the content easier to digest for the user

## Aligment
