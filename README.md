# Notes
A collection of notes I've made on various things I've learned.


## IMPORTANT ##
These are by no means meant as __THE GUIDE__ or best practices when creating a website. 

This is just a collection of things I've learned and want as a reference for later and me practicing markdown syntax to create better READ ME's.
